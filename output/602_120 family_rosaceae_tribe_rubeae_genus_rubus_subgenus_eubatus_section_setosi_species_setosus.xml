  <description type="morphology">Primocanes slender, 0.3-1.5 m. high or long, arched-ascending to erect, densely covered with hundreds or thousands of spreading to reflexed pale nearly uniform bristles; these scarcely resistant to touch, neither rigid nor pungent, 1.5-4 mm. long; primocane-leaves 3- or mostly 5-foliolate, on more or less bristly petioles; the leaflets lance- or oblong-ovate to slightly obovate or subrhombic, pale green, dull, plicate, double-serrate (or sometimes dentate), mostly acutish to acuminate, terminal leaflet distinctly petiolulate; floricanes reclining to upright, covered with fuscous bristles; the branching mostly sublateral or unilateral and prolonged on reclining or partially buried canes, more symmetrical and shorter on upright canes; floricane-leaflets narrowly obovate to oblong-rhombic, acutish to acuminate, one-third to three-fifths as broad as long; inflorescence a simple and racemose short corymb or a branching corymbiform panicle, its axis and pedicels setose; the lower bracts leaf-like, the upper greatly reduced; calyx-lobes usually bristly, 3.5-7.5 mm. long; petals 7-10 mm. long, 2-4 mm. broad; fruit inferior, dryish, subglobose, about 1 cm. in diameter. (Incl. R. nigricans Rydb., an erect and symmetrically branching state; and R. junior, significant, dissimilis, Ribes (erect and symmetrically branching state), notatus, Boottianus, condignus and tectus Bailey, states which, as individual collections, show some tendencies but which in a series of hundreds of nos. show little constancy, making up what the author of most of them would call a "small various bramble".)</description>
