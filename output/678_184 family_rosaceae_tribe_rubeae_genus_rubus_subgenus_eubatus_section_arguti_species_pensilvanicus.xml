(bearing leaves); flowers showy, 2-3 or more cm. broad; calyx-lobes soon reflexed; fruit squarish-subglobose to thick-ellipsoid, 1-3 cm. long, usually very juicy and of fine quality, rarely bitter. (Incl. many local phases which can scarcely be distinguished: R. Andrewsianus, orarius, pergratus and philadelphicus of Blanchard; R. laudatus Berger; and R. abactus, difformis, Hanesii, honorus, insons, litoreus, ozarkensis, parcifrondifer, pubifolius, rosarius and uniquus of Bailey)</description>
