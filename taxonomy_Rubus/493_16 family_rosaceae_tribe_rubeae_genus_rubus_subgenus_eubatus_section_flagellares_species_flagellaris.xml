  <description>Very long-creeping and prostrate, the canes eventually flat-trailing and usually rooting at tips. Primocanes up to 6 mm. thick at base, at first ascending, later depressed, becoming 2-5 m. long, slender toward tips, glabrous and with firm subulate but thick-based scattered and slightly recurved prickles 1-4 mm. long along the angles; leaves on slender subglabrous or merely puberulent or appressed-pilose prickleless or sparsely prickly petioles; leaflets 3 or 5, serrate or dentate, glabrous or with the veins beneath appressed-pilose; the terminal leaflet ovate to subelliptic, rounded to base, rather abruptly contracted (often shouldered) to an acuminate tip 0.5-2 cm. long, the petiolule elongate, the lateral leaflets subsessile and often asymmetrical, all glabrous or merely appressed-pilose on nerves beneath. Floricanes trailing, woody and tough, often reddish or purplish; flowering branchlets erect, those near base producing corymbs of (2-)3-9 (sometimes more) flowers on nearly erect filiform glabrous to merely puberulent or appressed-pilose (rarely remotely villous) prickleless or sparsely setose-prickly pedicels, the lower pedicels 3-9 (-12) cm. long; corymbs toward tip of floricane often reduced to 2 (or 1) flowers; bracteal leaves 3-foliolate or simple, glabrous or nearly so beneath and on glabrescent petioles, the terminal leaflet or the simple blade ovate, obovate or lanceolate, longer than broad; calyx pubescent; petals white, oblong to elliptic-oval or obovate, 1-1.5 cm long, 5-10 mm, broad; fruit relatively large, globose or slightly elongate, mostly 1-1.5 cm. in diameter, usually of rich flavor. (R. villosus of ed. 7, not Ait.; R. procumbens sensu many auth., not Muhl. as validated by Bart.; R. geophilus Blanch., thinner- and paler-leaved plants with most jagged toothing; R. alacer Bailey; R. fecundus Bailey, form with floricane- subacute)</description>
